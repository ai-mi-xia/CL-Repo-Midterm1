# CL-Repo-Midterm1
I plan to create a Joe Dispenza quote generator using 71 quotes from the community (heâ€™s a meditation teacher). The sketch will be in the background (perhaps some sort of star/space animation?). The idea is that every day someone can enter the page (or just refresh) to get a randomly picked quote for the day.
